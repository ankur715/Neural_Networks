*This project does not include what the image above displays, but it's added to show the usefulness of neural networks (possible future project)*

This repository include neural networks algorithms performed on 4 different datasets:
* Iris
* MNIST
* SVHN
* Pets  

The task for each dataset is included in the notebook.

The main library for this project was:
